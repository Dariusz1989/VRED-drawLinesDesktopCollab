# Sketch 3D Lines in VRED Standard Display Mode
### Enhance your Design Collaboration by drawing 3D Lines on 3D Geometry in VRED in Standard Display Mode.
### Interactively communicate design intent and potential issues virtually to your colleagues, directly in your VRED Environment.  Collaboration participants can see the drawings and sketches immediately, in realtime.
### The color of the drawn lines is defined by the chosen colour of your collaboration avatar.
### Lines can be tracked according to the line creators' collaboration name.
Simply paste the Python scrupt into the Script Editor within VRED and click run.

Press D to enable drawing. You will see a pencil which indicates that drawing is activated. Draw while keeping the left mouse button pressed and move your mouse cursor. You can draw directly onto geometry and create a "line" geometry per stroke.

Press D again to disable drawing. Press L to remove the last line. Press G to remove all the lines.

This script also works in VRED Collaboration. Please ensure that the script is executed on each computer of all participants.
